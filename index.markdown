# The Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA)

## Introduction and Overview

The Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA) was formed in 2011, after members of an international Incidence Assay Critical Path Working Group meeting researchers around the world [identified a need](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001045) for cultivated HIV specimens to aid development of new HIV incidence assays. Following that meeting, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided funding to create CEPHIA to support the development of existing and new HIV incidence assays, improve data analysis and interpretation of incidence assay results, and bring consensus to the field. Importantly, the consortium was charged with creating a consolidated repository of over 30,000 highly-selected and well-characterized plasma specimens from around the world, along with setting standards and conducting independent evaluations of existing and new incidence assays, in order to remove real or perceived assay developer bias and allow direct, objective comparison of HIV incidence assays. A second round of funding (“CEPHIA 2”) in 2013 expanded the expensive repository of well-characterized plasma specimens to include prospectively collected serum, dried blood spots, urine, saliva, and stool. More information about the work of CEPHIA during this phase is available [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/moving-towards-a-reliable-hiv-incidence-test-current-status-resources-available-future-directions-and-challenges-ahead/00CAA9784883BF7523D5F14F11BF35C7), as well as in the Evaluation Reports and standard specimen panels detailed on this website.

CEPHIA is strengthened by its wide membership (see Membership, below), including close work with the World Health Organization/UNAIDS Technical Working Group on HIV Incidence Measurement and Data Use. More information about CEPHIA and the need for centralized specimen archives can be found [here](https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/3-1511/v1). 

## Evaluation Reports

CEPHIA has conducted independent evaluations of 11 assays designed to assess recency of HIV infection (i.e. useful for estimating HIV incidence). The methods and findings of these evaluations are available in each of the Evaluation Reports (colloquially known as "blue books"), which can be accessed below:
